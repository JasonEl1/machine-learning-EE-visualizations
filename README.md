# machine-learning-EE-visualizations
Visualizations for my IB EE on machine learning. Experimenting with both Julia's Plots and Python's Matplotlib

### Python & Matplotlib

`pip install matplotlib`

After installing, import it into your Python program with `matplotlib.pyplot`.

### Julia & Plots

```
import Pkg
Pkg.add("Plots")
```
The above commands are only necessary to install the Plots library. After installing, import it into your julia program with `using Plots`.
